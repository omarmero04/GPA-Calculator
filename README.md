# GPA-Calculator
A command-line Grade Point Average (GPA) calculator built in Python. This interactive tool allows students to calculate their semester GPA by inputting their courses, credit hours, and grades. It features robust input validation to ensure data accuracy, handles multiple subjects, and provides a detailed letter grade equivalent to the calculated GPA.

This is an interactive, console-based GPA calculator developed in Python. It's designed to provide students with a quick and accurate way to determine their GPA based on a 4.0 grading scale. The program handles multiple subjects, calculates the weighted average (GPA), and provides a full performance assessment.
